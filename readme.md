# Third Portfolio 
   This is my third portfolio following project 2. This showcases the two group projects that we have done as well as two solo projects that I enjoyed working on. A more professional portfolio is planned in the future following project 3.

 ## Details about this project
    Third portfolio. Contains Project 1 (Kitschy), Project 2 (Handy Man), Weather Dashboard, and Password Generator.

 ## Some Code Snippets
 Below are a few code snippets. The first snippet sets my header and nav bar to the center and set their display as flex to make it mobile responsive. 

 ```
    h1 {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: flex-start;
    }

    header h2 {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
    }

    nav {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        font-size: 17px;
    }

    ul {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
    }
    ul li {
        margin-right: 20px;
        list-style-type: none;
    }
 ```

 Second code snippet gives all images a box shadow that changes depending on whether the cursor is hovering or active. 

 ```
    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #9e9e9e;
    }

    img:hover {
        box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #f52e2e;
    }

    img:hover:active {
        box-shadow: -10px -10px 5px #2eacf5;
    }
 ```

 This last code snippet sets the rest of the portfolio to be centered during all screen resolutions as well as set the icon links to a smaller size. 

 ```
    .container-1,
    .container-2, 
    .container-3 {
        margin-left: 20%;
        margin-right: 20%;
        font-size: 20px;
        text-align: center;
    }

    .container-3 img {
        width: 125px;
        height: 125px;
        margin: 10px;
    }
 ```

 ## Cloning down a copy

 To get a working copy on your machine you will need a few things such as access to Gitbash or Terminal, a working SSH key, a Github account, and a code reader like VS Code

 Once you have a working SSH key added to your Github account, navigate to the portfolio Repository. Click the green "code" button on the top right, select the ssh option, and save a copy to your clipboard.  

 Next: 
 Open Gitbash or Terminal and navigate to a directory that you would like to add the cloned repository. Once in your desired directory type in
 "git clone 'right click to paste'" and press enter. This will clone the repository onto your personal machine.


 Lastly: 
 Type 'ls' into your Gitbash or Terminal to see a list of items within the directory. If you have done the previous steps correctly then you should see a respository titled "portfolio." Simply type in "code ." to open it in your code editor of choice and have fun!
