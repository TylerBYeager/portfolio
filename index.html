        <h3>Hiya</h3>
        <p>My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. Allow me to share a bit about myself.
            I am 28 years old and originally from Arkansas although I am currently living in the Bay Area. In college I majored in Anthropology
            as I intended to become a famous archaeologist. Things changed and instead I went on to work for the Bureau of Land Management for the last three
            years as a Park Ranger in Utah and Colorado. My time as a Ranger granted me the opportunity to work with a variety of individuals from many different backgrounds. 
            I was constantly learning new skills and putting them to use whether that was in resource management or the leadership of volunteers and coworkers. 
            While I enjoyed the work, I knew I could do much more and so I undertook the challenge of becoming a fullstack software developer. I love to learn and challenge myself and new that
            becoming a software developer would allow me to do both. Currently, I enjoy working on practical applications that serve as a solution to make some task easier or more efficient.
