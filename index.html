        <h3>Hiya</h3>
        <p>My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. Thanks for checking out my portfolio. Allow me to share a bit about myself.
            I am 28 years old and originally from Arkansas although I am currently living in the Bay Area. In college I majored in Anthropology
            as I intended to become a famous archaeologist. Things changed and instead I went on to work for the Bureau of Land Management for the last three
            years as a Park Ranger in Utah and Colorado. My time as a Ranger granted me the opportunity to work with a variety of individuals from many different backgrounds. 
            I was constantly learning new skills and putting them to use whether that was in resource management or the leadership of volunteers and coworkers. 
            While I enjoyed the work, I knew I could do much more and so I undertook the challenge of becoming a fullstack software developer. I love to learn and challenge myself and new that
            becoming a software developer would allow me to do both. Currently, I enjoy working on practical applications that serve as a solution to make some task easier or more efficient.

        <h2 id="projects">Some of my Work</h2>
        <p>Here are a few example of the work that I have done so far. Future projects that I have in mind look towards E-commerce and the stock exchange/crypto currencies
            as they are finding themselves in a much more mainstream light nowadays.

            <h3>Kitschy: Your Kitchen Helper App</h3>
            <p>Kitschy began with the singular purpose of making shopping/meal-prepping
                a much easier experience for our users. The idea is that a user can search thousands of recipes, add their favorites, and, with a click of a button, generate a shopping list that combines
                all like ingredients between the recipes into a singular amount. Instead of having to worry about if one recipe needs two pounds of chicken and another needing six, Kitschy can tell our users
                the grand total amount they will need to get at the store in order to create each and every one of their saved meals. In addition, we were able to use Google Firebase to create a cloud sharing 
                feature that will allow users to share shopping lists between friends, family members, roommates, or whomever else might want to use it.</p>
